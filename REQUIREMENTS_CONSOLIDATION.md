# Requirements Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Consolidated multiple requirements files into a unified `requirements.txt` file.

## Source Files Processed
- `requirements-core.txt` - Core application dependencies
- `requirements-automation.txt` - Automation-specific dependencies  
- `requirements-ai.txt` - AI/LLM dependencies

## Changes Made

### 1. Duplicates Removed
- `fastapi==0.104.1` (was in core and automation)
- `sqlalchemy==2.0.23` (was in core and automation)
- `pydantic==2.5.0` (was in core and automation)
- `python-crontab==3.3.0` (was in core and automation)

### 2. Built-in Modules Removed
Removed Python built-in modules that don't need to be installed:
- `datetime`
- `logging`
- `json`
- `asyncio`

### 3. Redundant Entries Cleaned Up
From `requirements-core.txt`, removed duplicate entries:
- `python-multipart` (listed twice with different versions)
- `bcrypt` (listed twice)
- `email-validator` (listed twice)

### 4. AI Dependencies Handled Separately
- Commented out in main `requirements.txt` due to potential conflicts
- Created separate `requirements-ai-optional.txt` for AI features
- This allows installing AI dependencies only when needed

## Final Structure

### `requirements.txt` (Main)
- Core web framework (FastAPI, Uvicorn)
- Database dependencies (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy)
- Authentication & security
- Network automation (Netmiko, pyATS/Genie)
- HTTP clients and utilities

### `requirements-ai-optional.txt` (Optional)
- OpenAI, Groq, CrewAI
- LangChain, LangGraph
- ChromaDB, Anthropic
- Install separately when working on AI features

## Installation Instructions

### For Core Application:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### For AI Features (additional):
```bash
pip install -r requirements-ai-optional.txt
```

## Technology Stack Compatibility
