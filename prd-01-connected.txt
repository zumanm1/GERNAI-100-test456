# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Connected Version
## Network Automation Application with GENAI

### 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a network automation application that leverages GENAI, LLMs, and agentic AI to automate Cisco network operations. The application will support Cisco IOS, IOSXR, and IOSXE devices with dummy devices (R15-R25) for testing purposes.

This version of the PRD focuses on connecting the frontend to the backend and ensuring proper data flow between components.
