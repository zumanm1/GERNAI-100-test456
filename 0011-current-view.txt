# Current Project Status

## Objective
The primary goal is to integrate and validate the GENAI automation features. This involves fixing all backend bugs, ensuring stable server operation, and validating the end-to-end workflow with Puppeteer tests.

## Current State: Blocked
The application is currently **unstable and non-functional**. The backend server consistently crashes on startup, which prevents any further testing or development.

### Blocker: Backend Dependency Hell
The root cause is a series of cascading dependency conflicts within the AI-related packages (`requirements-ai.txt`).

**Latest Error:**
- `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
- This error originates from the `groq` library and persists even after pinning `httpx` and `httpcore`.

**Debugging History & Fixes Attempted:**
1.  **Initial Crash (`TypeError`)**: Fixed by updating `llm_providers.py` to correctly handle `temperature` and `max_tokens` kwargs.
2.  **`ImportError: OpenAI not found`**: Fixed by adding `requirements-ai.txt` to the `init_setup.sh` script.
3.  **`TypeError: 'proxies'` from `groq`**:
    - Attempted fix by pinning `httpx==0.27.0`. **Failed.**
    - Attempted fix by pinning `httpcore==1.0.5`. **Failed.**

## Other Changes Made:
- **`.gitignore`**: Corrected to exclude `node_modules`.
- **`init_setup.sh`**: Updated to install AI dependencies and clear ports 8001/8002.
- **`llm_providers.py`**: Refactored to handle provider-specific import errors gracefully.

## Next Steps (As per User Request)
1.  Commit all current changes (including fixes and the broken state) to GitHub to save progress.
2.  Halt further debugging attempts for now.
3.  Await further instructions.
