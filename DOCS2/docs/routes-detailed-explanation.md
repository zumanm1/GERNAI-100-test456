# Routes Detailed Explanation

This document provides detailed explanations of each route in the Network Automation Platform.

## Route Structure

The application uses React Router for navigation with the following route structure:

```
/ (Dashboard)
├── /automation (AI Automation)
├── /operations (Network Operations)
├── /devices (Device Management)
├── /settings (Application Settings)
├── /chat (AI Chat Interface)
└── /* (404 Not Found)
```

## Route Guards and Protection

Currently, the application uses a mock authentication system:
- All routes are accessible without authentication
- Mock admin user is automatically created
- No route protection is implemented

## Navigation Patterns

### Sidebar Navigation
- Primary navigation method
- Available on all routes
- Shows current active route
- Collapsible for mobile

### Breadcrumb Navigation
- Not currently implemented
- Could be added for deep navigation

### Programmatic Navigation
- Available via React Router hooks
- Used for redirects and form submissions
- Managed in component logic

## Route State Management

- Routes maintain their own local state
- Global state shared via React Context
- Supabase handles data persistence
- React Query manages server state
